# scraper :computer:
prnt.sc is a website for hosting screenshots taken with Lightshot. Since the url ids are not random you could easily run through every url and download the picture and that is exactly what this script does

:heavy_exclamation_mark: I do not take any responsibility for people using this script in harmful ways. I am working on this project for fun & to learn. I recommend using some sort of image recognition ai to detect sensitive content such as bank details and pornography because you probably do not want to save that to disk since it's illegal :heavy_exclamation_mark:
